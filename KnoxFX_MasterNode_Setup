     - 10GB of ROM storage
     - 500GB of available throughput with your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
     - No speed requirements for hardware or internet connection.  Let's assume a 56K modem will not do it but DSL, copper or fiber internet connection.
 
 Optional:

  - 
 
 Step 1: Install Wallet
  - A single Unbuntu machine with the wallet and node is allowed

  a) Go to https://knoxfs.com/
  b) At the top, view "Wallets" drop down
  c) Select a wallet based on the operating system
  d) Follow instructions based on operating system below
  
  Windows:
  a) Open "knoxfs-qt-Win64" ZIP file
  b) Extract "knoxfs-qt"
    - Note: Find a place you can remember its location.  This will launch the wallet going forward.
  c) Double clock on "knoxfs-qt"  
   - This launches the wallet with installation instuctions
  c) Select default data directory or custom data directory 
    - Note: 1 GB of storage is required
  d) Read and select the right arrow until the wallet UI appears
  
  Expected Outcome: You have "KFX Core - Wallet" running and visible in the user interface

  Step 2: Add 1000 KFX to Wallet
   - This assumes you have purchased 1001 or 1002 KXF coins from an exchange.  1000 KFX coins are required for the masternode collateral. 1 or 2 for network fees.
   
   a) In the Wallet, select "RECEIVE" from the left side menu
   b) Select "Copy" 
    - Note: If using a mobile device, the exchange or mobile wallet may allow scanning the QR code
   c)  Open the wallet or exchange wallet and go to "Withdraw"
    - Wallets and Exhanges are all different. Look for the ability to withdraw KFX native coin
   d) Use the receive address from the KFX Core and send 1001 or 1002
   
   Expected Outcome:  After 16 confirmations, the KFX coins appear in the "KFX Core - Wallet" wallet.
