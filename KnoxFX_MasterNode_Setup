KnoxFS Masternode Setup Guide

Assumptions: 
 - Faimiliar with Ubuntu 20.04 command line interface
 - Familiar with Windows or Mac
 - Understand what a masternode is
 - At least browsed through the White Paper found at https://knoxfs.com
 - Understand where to purchase KFX coin and how to transfer to a wallet
 
 Requirements:
 - Computer with a minimum specification:
     - 2 core or higher CPU
     - 10GB of ROM storage
     - 500GB of available throughput with your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
     - No speed requirements for hardware or internet connection.  Let's assume a 56K modem will not do it but DSL, copper or fiber internet connection.
 
 Optional:
  - Virtual Private Server hosted by a 3rd party
      - The KFX node explorer isn't currently showing IP addresses.  If you have concern publishing your IP address, VPS will work better.
      - If your local community has a VPS provider, see if they can provide that VPS service!  Just do a little homework to ensure the VPS can be available 24 hours a day.
      
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Step 1: Install Wallet
  
  - A single Unbuntu machine with the wallet and node is allowed
  - A computer running the wallet (Windows, Mac or Linux) and a seprarate computer running Ubuntu for the node is allowed.
  
  a) Go to https://knoxfs.com/
  b) At the top, view "Wallets" drop down
  c) Select a wallet based on the operating system
  d) Follow instructions based on operating system below
  
  Windows:
  a) Open "knoxfs-qt-Win64" ZIP file
  b) Extract "knoxfs-qt"
    - Note: Find a place you can remember its location.  This will launch the wallet going forward.
  c) Double clock on "knoxfs-qt"  
   - This launches the wallet with installation instuctions
  c) Select default data directory or custom data directory 
    - Note: 1 GB of storage is required
  d) Read and select the right arrow until the wallet UI appears
  
  Expected Outcome: You have "KFX Core - Wallet" running and visible in the user interface
  
--------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Add 1000 KFX to Wallet
   - This assumes you have purchased 1001 or 1002 KXF coins from an exchange.  1000 KFX coins are required for the masternode collateral. 1 or 2 for network fees
   - Given the somewhat low trade volume, it may take some time to get 1000 KFX coins
   
   a) In the Wallet, select "RECEIVE" from the left side menu
   b) Select "Copy" 
    - Note: If using a mobile device, the exchange or mobile wallet may allow scanning the QR code
   c)  Open the wallet or exchange wallet and go to "Withdraw"
    - Wallets and Exhanges are all different. Look for the ability to withdraw KFX native coin
   d) Use the receive address from the KFX Core and send 1001 or 1002
   
   Expected Outcome:  After 16 confirmations, the KFX coins appear in the "KFX Core - Wallet" wallet.  
   
--------------------------------------------------------------
   
Step 3: Backup & Encrypt Wallet 
   
     a) In the KFX Core Wallet, select "Settings".
     b) Select "Wallet"
     c) In the "Backup Wallet" page, select a file location and save the wallet in a place you can remember
     d) Encrypt the wallet by adding a paraphrase (password)
     e) (recommended) Make a copy of the .dat wallet file in another location in case the original gets corrupted
   
   Expected Outcome:  KFX Core - Wallet application will exit (Windows) and encrypt the wallet.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------
   
Step 4: Get Configuration File and Masternode Key
   Prerequisite - I believe the coins need to be confirmed in the wallet before performing this step.  May not be the case, but no downside to getting confirmations.
   
     a) In Windows 10, go to the search bar and type in "run".  Alternatively, press Windows key + r
     b) Type %appdata% in the run prompt and then enter
     c) Open the "KFX" folder, then open masternode.conf in notebook or an editor that won't change the file extension
      - Leave open, you are going to copy and paste values into masternode.conf file
      
     d) In "KFX Core - Wallet" application, select "Settings" from left menu
     b) Select "Debug", then "Console"
     c) Type in getmasternodeoutputs
     d) TBD 
     
     
     
     
--------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Connect to Masternode and Setup
     a) If using a remote VPS, get signed up, wait for the email containing the login credentials
     b) For either remote VPS or your own linux computer, install Putty or favorite SSH client.  Connect to the linux computer
     c) Type and run: sudo apt-get udpate && apt-get upgrade
     d) sudo apt install unzip
     e) sudo apt install mc
     f) Go to https://github.com/KnoxFS/ and find the latest version of Wallet. Usually "Wallet-5.x.x.x" repository and the file "kfx-5.x.x-x86_64-linux-gnu.zip"
     g) Copy link to the latest version of the file ending with "x86_64-linux-gnu.zip
     h) In the Putty linux command line terminal, navigate to a folder you want to store the "Wallet-5.x.x.x" file
     i) Type and run: wget <paste_url>.  Example: wget https://github.com/KnoxFS/Wallet-5.3.2.0/releases/download/v5.3.3/kfx-5.3.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.zip
